This here blog will soon be the location of http://thenerdings.blogspot.com,
once I migrate everything over.......

Octopress and Jekyll seem awesome! I'm jazzed to be able to write in my tricked-out text editor,
use git + github.io/github-pages to deploy, and to develop blog posts the way I develop code.
It jives with how I roll.  For a dude who gets huffy-puffy when the pointy-clicky things fight me,
a blogging platform made for hackers seems like a wonderful thing...here we go.
